To compile stats, you must have ncurses compiled and installed with C++ support. In the 
contrib/ncurses you will find spec files for some distributions. currently stats only functions when compiled static.
to rebuild ncurses:
download the source RPM for your distribution.
install the source RPM (rpm -Uhv <file>).
replace the spec file with our spec file
rebuild the RPM (rpm -ba <spec>)
install your built RPM (rpm -Uhv <file>.

In RedHat, built RPMs are put in /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/<arch>
In Mandrake, built RPMs are put in /usr/src/RPM/RPMS/<arch>
