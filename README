# Opuntia 

## Requirements

At this time, the source directory needs to be installed in /home/ubuntu/opuntia
This limitation will be removed in the future. This does not require ubuntu as the build OS only that the directory structure is required.


For docker build:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y make
make docker_run

To get into the container to build. 
sudo docker exec -it opuntia /bin/bash
