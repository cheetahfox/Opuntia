Notes for developers of Opuntia.

All code should be developed using Git Flow (http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model)

The Remine Git repository is set to track the develop branch by default and this is the branch you will receive when you clone.
Unfortunately git flow needs the branch set to master when you initialize git flow.

So here's how to set up git flow correctly.

1) Install the git flow addon
	git clone https://github.com/nvie/gitflow.git
	cd gitflow
	sudo make install
2) Change to your opuntia git checkout directory
	cd { your git opuntia checkout }
3) Change to the master branch of opuntia
	git checkout master
4) Initialize git flow and select the defaults (releases go to master NOT DEVELOP!!!)
	git flow init

Output should look like this:

Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
   - develop
   - master
Branch name for production releases: [master] 

Which branch should be used for integration of the "next release"?
   - develop
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop] 

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/] 
Release branches? [release/] 
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/] 
Support branches? [support/] 
Version tag prefix? [] 

*******************************************************
MAIN DEVELOPMENT LOOP

5) Start a new feature
	git flow feature start SomeCoolFeature
6) Develop, commit often, develop, commit more, etc
	git commit
7) Build and test
	Run the build script in the git checkout
	Testing: We should have VMs and real hardware
		to test on
8) Publish your feature for review
	git flow feature publish SomeCoolFeature
9) When approved/finalized finish the feature
	git flow feature finish SomeCoolFeature
10) GOTO step 5 (start a new feature - can reuse names)
